GRREAT
===

GRREAT is a tool written in Python that will integrate with Google GRR.
It will allow the user to hash the contents of a box with a piecewise algorithm and store the hashes.
The user could later hash the contents again to determine what has been changed and the extent of those changes.


### GRR
[GRR](https://github.com/google/grr) (for GRR Rapid Response) is an incident response framework focused on remote live forensics.
The [AsciiDoc documentation](https://github.com/google/grr-doc) is hosted in a separate repository.


### Piecewise hashing in Python

Two Python wrappers for *ssdeep* already exists:
- [python-ssdeep](https://github.com/DinoTools/python-ssdeep) - LGPLv3
- [pyssdeep](https://code.google.com/p/pyssdeep/) - BSD New
