    The journal_mode parameter controls the "Write-Ahead Log"
    introduced in recent SQLite versions. If set to "WAL", this log is
    used to save transaction data and can bring performance
    improvements. It does, however, require write permissions to the
    directory the database resides in since it creates the log file
    there. This can lead to problems with unit tests so we disable by
    default since we are mostly using the database in read only mode
    anyways.
